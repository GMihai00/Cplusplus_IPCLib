-udp client and server (boost::asio::ip::udp::socket), right now not suiting current infrastructure, will maybe add a separate 
lib with udp communication, but for certain it will not be added in IPC one.
-remove IPC legacy from solution and add a separate one. I think that UDP should of been used instead as the data being sent 
over the network is not really private, at least for the vehicles traveling, for the cameras tcp is still the way to go.
